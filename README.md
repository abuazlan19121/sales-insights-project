## Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware, a well-established computer hardware and peripheral manufacturer 
headquartered in New Delhi, operates through 10 branches across India. Despite the 
market's dynamic growth, the company has been experiencing a steady decline in sales. 
The Sales Manager has struggled to obtain accurate and consistent insights from regional 
managers, who often provide fragmented data in Excel files or rely on verbal reports. 
This has made it difficult to pinpoint the root causes of declining sales and hampered 
data-driven decision-making.
The current manual reporting process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and lacks the 
depth of insight necessary to adapt to the fast-changing market. Regional managers tend 
to assure the Sales Manager of future improvements without providing detailed analysis 
or actionable insights. As a result, the company is losing opportunities to optimize sales 
strategies, identify underperforming regions, and focus on high-demand products.
To address these challenges, Atliq Hardware aims to implement a robust, automated 
solution using Power BI. The objective is to replace manual reporting with a real-time, 
interactive dashboard that provides the Sales Manager and other key stakeholders with 
comprehensive, up-to-date sales insights. This system will pull data directly from the 
companyâ€™s database, streamlining the data collection process and reducing reliance on 
regional managers for fragmented reports.
The project will leverage SQL for data extraction, and Power BI for data visualization. 
This approach will provide the company with the tools necessary to monitor sales 
performance in real-time, track trends, and optimize decision-making processes. The 
automated solution is expected to save time, reduce costs, and improve the overall 
effectiveness of Atliq Hardware's sales strategies, ultimately driving increased revenue 
and competitiveness in the market.
